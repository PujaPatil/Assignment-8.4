 Explain the core changes made in Hadoop 2.x

Resource utilization in 2.x is done by resource manager and job monitoring is done by application manager 
whereas in 1.x both the above jobs are done by job tracker.

Scalability in 2.x is increased to 10,000 nodes and 1,00,000 task whereas in 1.x it was only 4000 nodes and 40,000 tasks.

cluster utilization in 2.x is better as resources are dynamic and fine grained and in 1.x the task tracker was configured with 
static slot moreover the map task dont run on reduce slots so the cluster utilization is poor.

2.x supports models all processing models other than MapReduce.
